      If you are a wine lover or just want to be challenged in something
      new or simply learn about Sicilian wine and food traditions, then
      this is the place. The very knowledgeable Rosanna will give you
      great recommendations, often combined with a careful selection of
      cheeses, ham, sausages or other goodies. The wine selection is
      exquisite and provides a very good representation of the new
      diversity of larger and smaller producers in Sicily."`,
